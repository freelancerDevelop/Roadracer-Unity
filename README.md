# Roadracer-Unity
The Roadracer test game I started in Threejs but in Unity

# Some progress gifs
At first had a feeling that having the camera looking from behind was the way to go.

But i soon realised that using a isometric had way cooler effect!

Trying to add some darkness to the game, with the functionality to see things by turning on your headlights or by using the light poles next to the road, but they won't help as much.

Later i tried to make some small cars in blender. So that it would look like a real car chase.

Also some small object were made to fill up the empty space between the trees and rocks

The police was added to have the feeling you were being chased.

What is a police chase without a roadblock in the way!
By always having small gap there is a way to get past the roadblock and score points by getting further with the chase

Tried changing the menu to something different than the static one, the first one is always the best but the let me show you what i had in mind with a different menu.
